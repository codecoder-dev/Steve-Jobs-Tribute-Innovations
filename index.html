              <h3>Apple 1</h3>
              <p>
                Although entirely designed by Steve Wozniak, Jobs had the idea
                of selling the desktop computer, which led to the formation of
                Apple Computer in 1976. Both Jobs and Wozniak constructed
                several of the first Apple I prototypes by hand, and sold some
                of their belongings in order to do so. Eventually, 200 units
                were produced.
              </p>

            <div class="innovation-card">
              <h3>Apple 2</h3>
              <p>
                The Apple II is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first
                highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed
                primarily by Wozniak (though Jobs oversaw the development of the
                Apple II's unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power
                supply). It was introduced in 1977 at the West Coast Computer
                Faire by Jobs and Wozniak and was the first consumer product
                sold by Apple.

            <div class="innovation-card">
              <h3>Apple Lisa</h3>
              <p>
                The Lisa is a personal computer designed by Apple during the
                early 1980s. It was the first personal computer to offer a
                graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual
                business users. Development of the Lisa began in 1978. The Lisa
                sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold. In 1982, after Jobs
                was forced out of the Lisa project, he joined the Macintosh
                project. The Macintosh is not a direct descendant of Lisa,
                although there are obvious similarities between the systems. The
                final revision, the Lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the
                Macintosh XL.

            <div class="innovation-card">
              <h3>Macintosh</h3>
              <p>
                Once he joined the original Macintosh team, Jobs took over the
                project after Wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane
                accident and temporarily left the company. Jobs introduced the
                Macintosh computer on January 24, 1984. This was the first
                mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical
                user interface and mouse. This first model was later renamed to
                "Macintosh 128k" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of
                subsequently updated models which are also based on Apple's same
                proprietary architecture. Since 1998, Apple has largely phased
                out the Macintosh name in favor of "Mac", though the product
                family has been nicknamed "Mac" or "the Mac" since the
                development of the first model. The Macintosh was introduced by
                a US$1.5 million Ridley Scott television commercial, "1984". It
                most notably aired during the third quarter of Super Bowl XVIII
                on January 22, 1984, and some people consider the ad a
                "watershed event" and a "masterpiece". Regis McKenna called the
                ad "more successful than the Mac itself". "1984" uses an unnamed
                heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by a
                Picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as
                a means of saving humanity from the conformity of IBM's attempts
                to dominate the computer industry. The ad alludes to George
                Orwell's novel, Nineteen Eighty-Four, which describes a
                dystopian future ruled by a televised "Big Brother. The
                Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to
                be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64
                for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its
                accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems
                still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept
                Apple as the second-largest PC manufacturer for the next decade.

              <h3>NeXT Computer</h3>
              <p>
                After Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985, he started NeXT, a
                workstation computer company. The NeXT Computer was introduced
                in 1988 at a lavish launch event. Using the NeXT Computer, Tim
                Berners-Lee created the world's first web browser, the
                WorldWideWeb. The NeXT Computer's operating system, named
                NeXTSTEP, begat Darwin, which is now the foundation of most of
                Apple's products such as Macintosh's macOS and iPhone's iOS. The
                Macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to
                be competitive in a market already dominated by the Commodore 64
                for consumers, as well as the IBM Personal Computer and its
                accompanying clone market for businesses. Macintosh systems
                still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept

              <h3>iMac</h3>
              <p>
                Apple iMac G3 was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design
                was directly the result of Jobs's return to Apple. Apple boasted
                "the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone
                else's. "Described as "cartoonlike", the first iMac, clad in
                Bondi Blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came
                before. In 1999, Apple introduced the Graphite gray Apple iMac
                and since has varied the shape, color and size considerably
                while maintaining the all-in-one design. Design ideas were
                intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle
                and a "breathing" light effect when the computer went to sleep.
                The Apple iMac sold for $1,299 at that time. The iMac also
                featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy
                disk drive and moving exclusively to USB for connecting
                peripherals. This latter change resulted, through the iMac's
                success, in the interface being popularized among third-party
                peripheral makersâ€”as evidenced by the fact that many early USB
                peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the iMac
                design).

              <h3>iTunes</h3>
              <p>
                iTunes is a media player, media library, online radio
                broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed
                by Apple. It is used to play, download, and organize digital
                audio and video (as well as other types of media available on
                the iTunes Store) on personal computers running the macOS and
                Microsoft Windows operating systems. The iTunes Store is also
                available on the iPod Touch, iPhone, and iPad. Through the
                iTunes Store, users can purchase and download music, music
                videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and
                movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the
                iPhone and iPod Touch (fourth generation onward). Application
                software for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch can be downloaded
                from the App Store.

              <h3>iPod</h3>
              <p>
                The first generation of iPod was released October 23, 2001. The
                major innovation of the iPod was its small size achieved by
                using a 1.8" hard drive compared to the 2.5" drives common to
                players at that time. The capacity of the first generation iPod
                ranged from 5 GB to 10 GB. The iPod sold for US$399 and more
                than 100,000 iPods were sold before the end of 2001. The
                introduction of the iPod resulted in Apple becoming a major
                player in the music industry. Also, the iPod's success prepared
                the way for the iTunes music store and the iPhone. After the
                first few generations of iPod, Apple released the touchscreen
                iPod Touch, the reduced-size iPod Mini and iPod Nano, and the
                screenless iPod Shuffle in the following years.

              <h3>iPhone</h3>
              <p>
                Apple began work on the first iPhone in 2005 and the first
                iPhone was released on June 29, 2007. The iPhone created such a
                sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten Americans were
                aware of its release. Time declared it "Invention of the Year"
                for 2007 and included it in the All-TIME 100 Gadgets list in
                2010, in the category of Communication. The completed iPhone had
                multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch
                screen smartphone. A year later, the iPhone 3G was released in
                July 2008 with three key features: support for GPS, 3G data and
                tri-band UMTS/HSDPA. In June 2009, the iPhone 3GS, whose
                improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a
                faster processor, was introduced by Phil Schiller. The iPhone 4
                was thinner than previous models, had a five megapixel camera
                capable of recording video in 720p HD, and added a secondary
                front-facing camera for video calls. A major feature of the
                iPhone 4S, introduced in October 2011, was Siri, a virtual
                assistant capable of voice recognition.
